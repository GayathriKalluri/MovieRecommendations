# Movie Recommendation System:
# Overview :
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques in Python. The system leverages user-item interaction data to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

# Techniques Used :
# Collaborative Filtering :
The collaborative filtering approach is employed to analyze user-item interactions and identify patterns to make movie recommendations based on user behavior.

# Machine Learning (SVD) :
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is utilized as a matrix factorization technique to uncover latent factors in the user-item interaction matrix, improving the accuracy of predictions.

# Libraries Used :
# scikit-learn:
The scikit-learn library is used for content-based filtering based on movie genres. It includes tools for natural language processing and text analysis.

# Results
The recommendation system generates personalized movie recommendations for users based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering using movie genres.

# Future Improvements
Integration of additional features for a hybrid recommendation system.
Experimentation with advanced collaborative filtering algorithms.
Deployment of the recommendation system in a production environment.
